Pulp ansible modules
===

This project project aims to provide a complete set of ansible modules to control a pulp3 server in a descriptive way.
This is neither to be confused with ansible-pulp to install pulp, nor pulp\_ansible to manage ansible content in pulp.

Testing
---

Testing infrastructure has been wildly inspired by the sister project [foreman-ansible-modules](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-ansible-modules).
Look at the documentation there for now.
